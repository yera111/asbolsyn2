   - Represents food businesses selling leftover meals
   - Fields: telegram_id, name, contact_phone, status
   - Status can be: pending, approved, rejected

2. **Consumer Model**
   - Represents users who purchase meals
   - Fields: telegram_id

3. **Meal Model**
   - Represents food items listed by vendors
   - Fields: name, description, price, quantity, pickup times, location
   - Location includes: address text, latitude, longitude
   - Has is_active flag for soft deletion

4. **Order Model**
   - Represents purchases made by consumers
   - Fields: status, payment_id
   - Status can be: pending, paid, completed, cancelled

5. **Metric Model**
   - Represents tracked events for analytics and MVP hypothesis evaluation
   - Fields: metric_type, value, entity_id, user_id, metadata, timestamp
   - Used for tracking key user interactions throughout the application

### Database Connection (`src/db.py`)
Handles initializing and closing database connections using Tortoise ORM.

### Bot Implementation (`src/bot.py`)
Uses aiogram framework for implementing the Telegram bot:
- Implements command handlers (/start, /help, /register_vendor, /add_meal, /my_meals, /delete_meal, /browse_meals)
- Provides an intuitive keyboard menu for common functions
- Uses button handlers to respond to menu interactions
- Automatically registers consumers
- Implements Finite State Machine (FSM) for vendor registration and meal creation flows

- Initializes database connection on startup

### Metrics System (`src/metrics.py`)
Implements comprehensive analytics for tracking MVP hypothesis:
- Provides standardized tracking function for recording metrics events
- Implements reporting capabilities for generating analytics dashboards
- Supports conversion funnel analysis (browse ‚Üí view ‚Üí order ‚Üí payment)
- Provides admin-only metrics dashboard via the `/metrics` command
- Tracks key performance indicators aligned with business goals:
  - User acquisition (registrations)
  - Engagement (meal creation, browsing)
  - Conversion (order creation, payment)
  - Sales performance (GMV, completed orders)
- Non-blocking implementation ensures failures don't affect core application flow
- Supports filtering by time period and metric types

## User Interface

The bot provides a user-friendly interface through:

1. **Persistent Keyboard Menu**
   - Accessible throughout the entire user journey
   - Always visible after every interaction with the bot
   - Includes buttons for browsing meals, finding nearby meals, vendor registration, and help
   - Buttons trigger the same functionality as their corresponding commands
   - Makes the bot more accessible to users unfamiliar with Telegram commands

2. **Button Handler System**
   - Each keyboard button has a corresponding message handler function
   - Handler functions are registered using aiogram's message filters:
     ```python
     @dp.message(lambda message: message.text == "üìã –ü—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –±–ª—é–¥–∞")
     async def button_browse_meals(message: Message):
         await cmd_browse_meals(message)
     ```
   - Button handlers delegate to command handlers to maintain consistent behavior
   - Complete coverage ensures all interactive elements respond correctly
   - Main menu buttons with dedicated handlers:
     - "üìã –ü—Ä–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –±–ª—é–¥–∞" (Browse Meals) ‚Üí calls cmd_browse_meals
     - "üìç –ë–ª—é–¥–∞ –ø–æ–±–ª–∏–∑–æ—Å—Ç–∏" (Nearby Meals) ‚Üí calls cmd_meals_nearby
     - "üõí –ú–æ–∏ –∑–∞–∫–∞–∑—ã" (My Orders) ‚Üí calls cmd_my_orders
     - "üè™ –ó–∞—Ä–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤—â–∏–∫" (Register as Vendor) ‚Üí calls cmd_register_vendor

   - Logs all deactivation events for troubleshooting

2. **Expired Meal Filtering**
   - All meal browsing and search functions filter out expired meals
   - Uses current Almaty time for comparisons
   - Prevents users from seeing or purchasing meals past their pickup window
   - Ensures consistent handling across all meal-related operations

3. **Timezone-Aware Queries**
   - Database queries use timezone-aware datetime comparisons
   - All expiration checks consider the Almaty timezone
   - Consistent filtering throughout the application

## Security Architecture

## Metrics & Analytics System

The application includes a comprehensive metrics system to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and evaluate the success of the MVP hypothesis:

1. **Database Schema**
   - `Metric` model stores individual metric events with the following fields:
     - `metric_type`: Categorizes the metric (user registration, meal view, order paid, etc.)
     - `value`: Numeric value associated with the event (default 1.0 for counts)
     - `entity_id`: Optional ID of the related entity (meal, order, etc.)
     - `user_id`: Optional Telegram user ID to track user behavior
     - `metadata`: JSON field for additional contextual data
     - `timestamp`: When the metric was recorded (timezone-aware)

2. **Metric Types**
   - User acquisition metrics: `USER_REGISTRATION`, `VENDOR_REGISTRATION`, `VENDOR_APPROVAL`
   - Engagement metrics: `MEAL_CREATION`, `MEAL_BROWSE`, `MEAL_VIEW`, `NEARBY_SEARCH`
   - Conversion metrics: `ORDER_CREATED`, `ORDER_PAID`, `ORDER_COMPLETED`, `ORDER_CANCELLED`
   - Behavioral metrics: `PORTION_SELECTION` for tracking order sizing preferences

3. **Tracking Implementation**
   - `track_metric()` function provides a standardized way to record metrics
   - Non-blocking implementation ensures failures don't affect core application flow
   - Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
   - Automatic metadata collection for rich context

4. **Reporting Capabilities**
   - `get_metrics_report()` generates comprehensive reports with:
     - Event counts by type
     - Conversion rates (browse ‚Üí view ‚Üí order ‚Üí payment)
     - User acquisition statistics
     - Engagement metrics (meals per vendor, average order value)
     - Transaction metrics (sales per day)
   - Time-based filtering allows for period comparisons
   - Custom metric type filtering for targeted analysis
   - Timezone-aware date handling for accurate period-based reporting

5. **Dashboard for Administrators**
   - Admin-only `/metrics` command provides real-time access to key metrics
   - Overview section shows high-level performance indicators
   - Weekly conversion rates to identify funnel bottlenecks
   - Aggregated statistics on users, vendors, meals, and orders
   - Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) calculation
   - Consistent definition of "active meals" that matches the browse view (is_active=True, quantity>0, pickup_end_time in the future)
   - Proper timezone handling ensures metrics are calculated for the correct time periods

6. **Strategic Metrics Alignment**
   The metrics system is designed to answer key business questions from the [Game Design Document](game-design-document.md):
   - User Acquisition: How many users and vendors are onboarding?
   - Engagement: How many meals are vendors listing per week?
   - Sales Performance: How many meals are sold and what is the conversion rate?
   - Revenue: What is the total GMV transacted through the platform?
   - Retention: Are vendors continuing to list meals after initial registration?

7. **Integration Points**
   Metrics are recorded at key points in the user journey:
   - When users first interact with the bot
   - During vendor registration and approval
   - When meals are created by vendors
   - During meal browsing and detailed viewing
   - Throughout the order and payment process
   - During special interactions like nearby search

8. **Timezone Considerations**
   - All date calculations in metrics use the Almaty timezone (UTC+6)
   - Date ranges are properly timezone-aware to ensure accurate reporting
   - Dashboard data is generated using timezone-consistent queries
   - Metrics filtering ensures all timestamps are compared in the same timezone
   - Time-period based analysis accounts for timezone differences

9. **Future Extensions**
   The metrics system is designed for extensibility:
   - Additional metric types can be easily added
   - The reporting system can accommodate new analysis requirements
   - The underlying database schema supports detailed drill-down analysis
   - The framework supports future visualization integrations
