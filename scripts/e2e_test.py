End-to-End Testing Script for As Bolsyn Bot

This script documents the comprehensive testing process for validating all
core features of the As Bolsyn bot in the production environment.

Requirements:
- Two Telegram accounts (one for vendor, one for consumer)
- Admin access to approve vendors
- The bot deployed in production

NOTE: This is NOT an automated test script, but rather a structured guide for manual testing.
